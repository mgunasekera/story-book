once upon a time there was a troll that lived on an island. He was the only troll out of the many giants that lived on the island. They teased him and made fun of him everyday.
he was very sad and lonely and he had no friends
however, he had a secret, he had magical powers, wow so cool
one day, he got so angry that he used his powers to make a plane
he flew off the island and landed in Manhattan
in, manhattan, everyone was nice to him and he was never made fun of again
and he lived happily ever after
